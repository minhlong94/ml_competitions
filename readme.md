# Personal code for fast ML competitions
## What is it?
I am joining ML competitions hosted on Kaggle. Rewriting the training code from scratch takes a lot of time, so I make this repo to save the code.
## What do you have?
I currently have:
- LightGBM with KFold from DataFrame (LGBM_DF_KFold.py)
- Keras ImageDataGenerator from directory (KerasIDG_Directory.py)
- Keras ImageDataGenerator from DataFrame (KerasIDG_DF.py)
I will update regularly when I come up with a new one.
## How do I use it?
Copy the full code from the file, pass the params and you are good to go!
